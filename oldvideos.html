        <h2>TheComputerGuy96's old &amp; rejected videos</h2>
        <hr/>
        <div class="text">
        <p>I signed up to YouTube in February 2009 when I was 12 years old (I wasn't even supposed to do it since YouTube's terms of service say you have to be at least 13 to sign up for a YouTube account). This "TheComputerGuy96" account actually replaces my first-ever YouTube account named "ale12396" (I wanted ale123 but it was taken), made in September 2008, which had about 200 subscribers and got suspended because of inappropriate commenting (when you're this young you're prone to doing stupid shit).</p>
        <p>Upon making this "TheComputerGuy96" channel I got a little better, but was still young. I made videos very frequently, especially in 2009 and 2010, most of which were pretty lame. This is why they're now unlisted (thankfully I didn't delete them).</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/ale96123" target="_blank">To see some of the even older videos that were on the "ale12396" channel instead, click here.</a></p>
		<p>Also in this page are present some newer videos which I never made public for the same reason: they weren't good enough.</p>
        <p>So here is the list! Videos are ordered from oldest to newest. Start reading from the bottom (<a href="#bottom">click here to jump there</a>) if you want the reversed order.</p>
		<p>None of the videos linked in this page are monetized by me, if a video has ads it's because of a copyrighted song. All YouTube video links open in a new tab.</p>
        <p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdnomaid">dnomaid</a> on Twitter for suggesting to move this page to GitHub since Dropbox has removed the ability to use your "Public" folder as a website.</p>

		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHcMsEGsdMk" target="_blank">Glitch in ComputerKid117's channel</a></h3><p>YouTube back in early 2009 was customizable as hell.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1zBmfYTf1M" target="_blank">Speedtest.net results at school</a></h3><p>Middle school. I actually got my whole class in trouble because of this, the teacher wanted us to concentrate on whatever work we had to do.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xuZC2d8_MA" target="_blank">A day at the computer shop</a></h3><p>Trip to electronics stores used to really excite me. Now I still enjoy going to them, but I'm definitely not as excited. Filmed in beautiful 144p with a Motorola V1075 (couldn't afford an iPhone 3G, and even if I could it couldn't take videos!)</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2636dyuR2o" target="_blank">Windows Hack Vista ad</a></h3><p>Something put together with screen shots by ComputerKid117 and whatever came up first in the search results of "Mac sounds remix".</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK0kvbzrvXM" target="_blank">10 minutes of Windows XP setup</a></h3><p>So exciting. Just kidding.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnXH0yJKvLs" target="_blank">ComputerKid117's smoke detector sucks</a></h3><p>It made a pretty annoying sound.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CGlK3Rmcy0" target="_blank">The best DreamScene wallpaper ever!</a></h3><p>Literally a plain wallpaper animated with Windows Movie Maker.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD-gz2DlUno" target="_blank">How long does it take for my Windows Vista PC to reboot?</a></h3><p>Back then I had an HP Pavilion tower PC from 2008, with Windows Vista Home Premium, an AMD Phenom 9500 quad-core processor, 3GB of RAM, and a 500GB 7200rpm hard drive. I still have it, running Windows 10, but it's not used much today. I really liked Vista because it was much more beautiful than XP, but it was slow.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhAN1BBMcA8" target="_blank">Windows 16 Parody</a></h3><p>Some youtuber which I forgot the name of inexplicably made up startup sounds for every version of Windows from 7 to 16. Another one made a "windows 07 parody" (back when Windows 7 didn't exist yet). I combined the two ideas to make this video.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSPqYQVY-jc" target="_blank">My Windows XP laptop looking like Vista</a></h3><p>Never uploaded online, this was a personal video made in mid 2008 before I had any YouTube accounts. This was on my 2005 Acer Aspire 1690 which came with XP. These days I was able to put Windows 10 on it after upgrading the RAM (try telling my past self this is possible!), but sadly in early 2014 the video card started corrupting and in late 2015 it took down the entire computer along with it, like cancer.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fg8A3DWk3sA" target="_blank">How to type squares in Windows XP</a></h3><p>Probably just an unsupported character. Also bonus Easter egg at the end</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S18dUxh3ME4" target="_blank">Installing Ubuntu 7.10</a></h3><p>The first Linux distribution I ever tried was Ubuntu 8.04 (back when it was the latest version) which I installed on my computer with Wubi, but how about something a little older?</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpEkoAPAkks" target="_blank">Installing Ubuntu 4.10</a></h3><p>Obviously 7.10 wasn't old enough, so here's the first version of Ubuntu.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV2RliMAiEE" target="_blank">Help with my iPod nano 3G</a></h3><p>I lost that iPod on a school trip on April 17, 2009. I got an iPod nano 5G months later, which I still have, but of course I use smartphones now.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UzLjQCxHt0" target="_blank">The best YouTube glitch ever!</a></h3><p>Easter egg or just snarky programmer comment accidentally released publicly.</p></li>

		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgPBGMCdESU" target="_blank">Windows XP vs. Vista</a></h3><p>Utterly horrible and unfair comparison of boot times.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WgGnEP7p3A" target="_blank">HD test</a></h3><p>HD 720p video support had been out for a while, but when it was first out you had to have really weird settings to get the "watch in HD" option to be available, you couldn't just upload a video at 1280*720 resolution and that was it. I think around this time it became easier to upload HD videos.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KaQHkVi1AM" target="_blank">Best Friends on YouTube</a></h3><p>I don't think I talk to any of them today.</p></li>

		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hmUfUWxt-M" target="_blank">Setting up Speech Recognition in Windows 7 beta</a></h3><p>I could never try it in Windows Vista because I had the Italian version and Speech Recognition is only in English. But when I installed the Windows 7 beta in English, I could finally try it.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHOhpya6DfA" target="_blank">Windows Speech Recognition in Internet Explorer 8</a></h3><p>More testing</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm44INYssjc" target="_blank">Microwaving a CD-R</a></h3><p>First and last video of myself microwaving something. That microwave oven later died (it was a cheap one from Lidl) so we got another cheap one by a brand called "Candy" which still works today.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPPZWZ1PE4Y" target="_blank">YouTube Mobile test</a></h3><p>Ah, the joys of 144p video before smartphones could film in HD. It also costed me a fortune to upload it via MMS.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LModBBYRVlo" target="_blank">YouTube last sign in glitch</a></h3><p>Remember when you could see when a user last signed in?</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D0_Vb-WlK4" target="_blank">A problem I'm having when installing Windows XP</a></h3><p>I couldn't get Windows XP Service Pack 2 to re-install on this HP Pavilion from 2002 which came with XP. The trick was to install the RTM version with no service packs and update it after installing. That computer is gone today, but I still have its 40GB IDE hard drive which mostly works, and I use its AMD Athlon XP processor to comb my beard.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyGC2l8onFs" target="_blank">Windows 7 vs. Vista vs. Ubuntu 9.04</a></h3><p>Another stupid and unfair comparison</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ9pRIEOoWg" target="_blank">I got Ubuntu 9.04!</a></h3></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jr80KbgBo1k" target="_blank">New YouTube feature!</a></h3><p>Clickbait titles in 2009! (The feature is just seeing the video time when you hover on the time bar thing under the video)</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N46y-SbrXo" target="_blank">How to create groups on YouTube</a></h3><p>I hardly remember them.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9mSuF8xIXc" target="_blank">Crushing cassette tape with a vise</a></h3><p>It exploded! Imagine how cool the slow motion video would have looked if I'd had a camera that could record in 120fps, like today.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRy4KCsW_9Y" target="_blank">How to download Windows 7 RC</a></h3><p>It was a rock solid OS even in beta/RC stage, and I remember using it as my main OS (dual booting with Vista of course because the Windows 7 beta expired after a while). But then again, the Windows 8 and 10 betas were also stable (as seen in my "jailbreaking iPhone with Windows 10 technical preview" video).</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uffgrfG7tM" target="_blank">Fred subscribed to my channel!</a></h3><p>Remember when "fred" was the most popular YouTube user?</p></li>

		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PCdbYRqe2k" target="_blank">IRC Worm Fagot.exe on Windows XP</a></h3><p>Made popular by YouTube user danooct1, where he initially just showed it running on Windows 98. Later he re-made a better video himself showing how that worm runs on XP.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfENUP2hHnE" target="_blank">Weird error in Windows Vista</a></h3><p>This is what happens when the Windows Vista setup app crashes.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPfjpWrp2YU" target="_blank">Dropping my camera while recording!</a></h3></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNQmN52fKGo" target="_blank">Video uploaded straight from my camera</a></h3><p>By that I mean without editing. I always edited videos, even if it was just a single clip, to reduce the file size so it would upload faster.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekzkQkkf56w" target="_blank">You Got Mail!</a></h3><p>I didn't experience AOL dial-up, of course, but you can make an AOL email for free anywhere in the world (or at least you could back then).</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TTPSj3r7do" target="_blank">iPod touch 2G unboxing</a></h3><p>My first iOS device! Of course back then it wasn't called iOS.</p></li>

		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvN5pUIZ4Ng" target="_blank">Nintendo Wii test</a></h3><p>My family's first video game console! Yup, I've never had a PlayStation, Xbox or older Nintendo growing up. Not even a portable one like a Game Boy, Nintendo DS or PSP. I "only" had a computer, which arguably isn't a bad thing at all. My brother got an Xbox 360 in 2011, and that's the only two gaming consoles we have.</p></li>

I'm glad it survived; I now use it as a bootable install drive for Mac OS X El Capitan on my 2015 HP laptop.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gmw9aPadvo" target="_blank">Windows XP fucked up my laptop!</a></h3><p>Don't try installing Windows XP on a USB flash drive, even if setup recognizes it!</p></li>

		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbyQoHlRuNo" target="_blank">Prank call to Apple</a></h3><p>Don't watch this video, you'll waste your time. It's literally 7 minutes of waiting on hold, then saying "not telling" when they finally pick up and hanging up.</p></li>

        <li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHYzRAH3sco" target="_blank">Ninna Nanna FireBuntu</a></h3><p>When I was 12 years old, I got on this youtuber's nerves because I acted immature, so he made a "ninna nanna" (= lullaby) video about me, saying things like I should go to sleep like the baby I am instead of doing stupid shit on the Internet. After a while, I made one about him in retaliation.</p></li>

I hated Vodafone back then, I preferred TIM (Telecom Italia Mobile). In November 2010 however I switched back to Vodafone because everyone had it so texts were cheaper for everyone, and I still have it today, because carriers don't matter too much these days, people just use Internet apps like WhatsApp to communicate.</p></li>

He was obsessed with Lady Gaga whom I hate.</p><p>Here's a story: Earlier this year (2016) I logged in to my Tumblr account for the first time in almost three years. On my Tumblr home page I noticed some sexually suggestive photos of young men from a blog I don't remember following. Turns out it's this very person, this former Internet friend, who wrote he's gay.<br/>What's great is that one of my former high school classmates also really likes Lady Gaga, it turned out he's gay, and shares the sexual photos he likes online (except he does it by "liking" photos on Instagram instead of re-blogging them on Tumblr). I'm also gay, but I've never liked Lady Gaga, neither her nor her music, and the porn stuff I like I fucking keep to myself. It's intriguing how some people can appear very similar yet be very different at the same time.<p></li>

Back then the YouTube video page would say "Uploaded using iPhone". And for some reason the video quality got reduced by a lot, something which wouldn't have happened on a real iPhone.</p></li>

I later found out it even has Wi-Fi (they call it WLAN), but it only supports WEP and WPA, not WPA2 which my network uses. The broken keys in question are still broken now. The phone works, but it's almost unusable without those keys.</p></li>

I used a very similar method to get Mac OS X El Capitan working on my 2015 HP laptop (but less hacks because that laptop has an Intel processor instead of AMD), but while Mac OS X on the HP laptop works fine, on the HP desktop it's the reason I had to reset the BIOS in the "bad news" video.

We asked for a replacement, and they gave us this one that looked the same but was very crippled and was by a weird brand called "Industrie Dial Face". First, the Wi-Fi network SSID was hidden and there was no way to change it, not even if you opened the router settings at the gateway address. Second, and most importantly, it wouldn't let me upload any file larger than 1 MB. I couldn't upload YouTube videos anymore. Until months later, when we bought a new router by a better brand: NETGEAR (DGN2000). It worked just fine but we replaced it with a slightly better model (DGND4000) in 2014.</p></li>

If you held the phone in a certain way, the antennas would get blocked and the phone would lose signal. It also happens with other phones, but you have to hold them really tight where the antenna is, while on the iPhone 4 you didn't need any effort. To fix it you just had to put a case on the phone.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVHqIsogeLA" target="_blank">Windows XP on a Windows Vista-designed PC</a></h3><p>On my 2008 HP PC. Similar to vwestlife in his video about the Compaq "Walmart Special" PC. In fact the design of those computers is similar. Of course I didn't replace any hardware, I just replaced the OS.<br/>I want to upgrade this computer like vwestlife did, but because it has an AMD processor, my choices are a bit more limited. The motherboard this computer has (ASUS NARRA3) has a Socket AM2+ processor, and when I looked it up I found the best processor for it is an AMD Phenom II (it currently has a first generation AMD Phenom). I don't know if it maxes out at 4GB of RAM or I can go all the way up to 8 (it has 3 now). Also it could do with a better power supply (it has a Bestec but not one of the dangerous ones) and a dedicated graphics card. Finally it could do with an SSD (even a cheap &euro;40 120GB one, and the 500GB hard drive it currently has will become secondary). Maybe it could even be a decent gaming PC, better than my current laptop with an Intel Core i7-4510U, 8GB RAM, 500GB SSD, and NVIDIA GeForce 820M, which runs GTA V at 720p at 30fps. (Nah, I doubt it).</p></li>

That was my favorite iPhone and iOS 6 is my favorite version of all time. I kept iOS 6.1.2 jailbroken on it for a very long time (even after buying my HTC One M7). In September 2013, when iOS 7 came out, I restored it to iOS 7.0 and gave it to my mom, then in December she got an iPhone 5S so this 4S went to my younger brother, then in December 2014 the events of the "bent iPhone" video happened, so I bought myself a OnePlus One and gave my HTC to him, got this 4S back, <a href="https://twitter.com/TCG96/statuses/609674534925508608">installed iOS 9 beta on it</a>, then in June 2015 when an iOS 6 downgrade method came out, I downgraded it back to the then-latest non-beta iOS version (8.3), jailbroke it, and <a href="https://twitter.com/TCG96/statuses/615452462615523328">downgraded it to iOS 6.1.3</a>. (Now my brother has a Samsung Galaxy S6 and the HTC One M7 went to my even younger sister, which still works great but the camera doesn't focus anymore). I really missed iOS 6, it's so much more beautiful than the newer versions, but in 2016 it's pretty old, and on this broken iPhone 4S it's not very usable...</p></li>

		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87GW7_feQ7Q" target="_blank">Volkswagen Scan</a></h3><p>I downloaded the "Shuric Scan" Sony Vegas project file that's floating around the Internet, and I added a video clip I recorded of my dad's car, a Volkswagen Passat TDI 4motion station wagon from 2002.<br/>This car, even if it's a VW with a turbocharged direct injection, actually <b>isn't</b> involved in the "Volkswagen diesel cheating emissions scandal". The involved cars are anything that has a 2.0 TDI engine <i>and</i> is from between 2009 and 2015. That includes some cars by VW but also all car companies owned by them, <b>including</b> Audi, SEAT, and &Scaron;koda (have you noticed their diesel models are all called TDI?). Even if my dad's car was from 2009-2015, it wouldn't have had cheating emissions anyway, because it only has a 1.9 TDI engine! I wish it <i>was</i> involved though, so we would have gotten <a href="https://twitter.com/TCG96/status/746137993795215360" target="_blank">this sweet compensation</a>! <br/>And besides, the "scandal" is simply them saying it pollutes this much when it actually pollutes a little more. Cheating <i>was</i> a mistake on VW's behalf (again, it's also Audi, Seat and &Scaron;koda, they're all owned by VW), but it's not as scandalous as everyone wants you to think, and I think VW should have been sued for less.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuheyfHuIkE" target="_blank">Peugeot Scan</a></h3><p>Same thing as before, but with my mom's Peugeot 208 from 2014 instead. The clip is taken from the """driving fast""" video.<br/>There's not much to say about this car. It has a 1.2 gas engine running at 60 KW (about 80 hp), so it's less powerful than my dad's 1.9 96 KW (130 hp) car, but it's more powerful than the 1.6 diesel version I saw on an ad, which only has 75 hp! So just because it's a diesel and it makes a lot of noise, doesn't mean it's more powerful. Over here diesel cars are <i>very</i> common, I don't know if it's a thing of Europe, Italy, or just my area. If I need a diesel car, I can always borrow my dad's.<br/>This 208 still reaches illegal speeds very easily, so there's little to dislike about it. The only disadvantage of the less powerful engine is that it takes longer to accelerate. It has cruise control, USB and aux ports, and Bluetooth, which my dad's car doesn't have. Also, because it's smaller, it's easier to park. For what it is, this car is good, I can't complain. It's cheap, and it's not a fucking Fiat Punto. What more do you bloody want, a yacht? You can't have a yacht, we're only looking at cars. God, some people. <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4DbeFvo19I">(reference)</a></sup></p></li>

It lasts for less than two minutes running Memetest86 (a spin-off of Memtest86). With the OS running it lasts for 10 minutes. In February 2016 this computer will be 6 years old.</p></li>

If you look up "Super Mario Bros. NES corruption" after knowing how Super Mario Bros. on the NES looks and sounds like, those videos are excellent nightmare fuel.</p></li>

This test is shot with my OnePlus One at 1080p 60fps (in poor lighting conditions), testing the same Discman and the same "intro" feature, but this time it's connected to this boom-box stereo my dad got for free from his work and it plays Coldplay's seventh album "A Head Full Of Dreams". I don't have any other Coldplay CDs.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtXoPImrFpM" target="_blank">Hackintosh recording test</a></h3><p>My MacBook Pro could technically run Mac OS X El Capitan, but because of some conflict with the EFI firmware and the hard drive I installed myself it won't run anything newer than Mac OS X 10.8.2 (I kept 10.7.5 on it though because there are newer versions of 10.8, but 10.7 can be fully updated). So here comes my 2015 HP laptop to the rescue. I got Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan working on it with very little hacks (I installed a legit unmodified copy downloaded from the Mac App Store from my real MacBook, the few hacks are done through the Clover EFI bootloader, dual booting with Windows 10 just fine), and it's about as good as a &euro;2000 macbook, except it has a crappier display (but because this laptop was &euro;600 plus &euro;160 for the SSD I'm not complaining). I can install any update just fine, just like a real Mac, as long as the Clover bootloader stays updated.</p></li>
		<li><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/RtMjpSucnsI" target="_blank">Terminal gone crazy 2: epic fail</a></h3><p>I decided to re-make my "Terminal Gone Crazy" video with a newer version of Mac OS X, but unfortunately it doesn't work the same way. I tried the same exact method on Mac OS X Lion on my real MacBook and it worked (the dock icon badge number was increasing very rapidly).</p></li>
        <li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4is0B363tY" target="_blank">HP 15 vs. HP Stream 13</a></h3><p>Boot-up comparison. The HP stream (blue laptop) is my brother's laptop, but he rarely uses it so I was able to get a hold of it for this video. It has the installation of Windows 10 that came with it. The only extra programs installed are Google Chrome, MS Office 2016 and some HP stuff, but there are no programs on start-up. My own laptop has no HP bloatware because I did a clean installation of Windows 10, but it has a lot of shit set to run at start-up. My laptop has a 500GB Samsung SSD 850 EVO, the other has a 32GB eMMC. Both computers are fully updated and have fast startup turned off.<br/>This was like the fourth take of it. Why the fuck is it so hard to film a boot up comparison?<br/>The eMMC of the hp stream can survive being shaken while running, like an ssd and unlike a mechanical hard drive, but it's as slow as a mechanical hard drive.<br/>I cropped the video because I have a shortcut to lock the computer in the startup folder, and I was too lazy to censor my private email that was showing on the lock screen. Can't wait for the Windows 10 anniversary update that hides it! The hp stream reached the desktop in around 1m14s.<br/>The monitor behind the laptops is a 21.5-inch 1080p HP x22LED monitor, but by perspective it looks much smaller than the 15- and 13-inch laptops!<br/>I'm thinking of doing a comparison video about the two HP laptops even if it's pointless. If I do, it will have the same intro as the video of my HP 15, the one that says "after making a video about this HP laptop, here's another one".</p></li>
        <li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qSLHvZUfkA" target="_blank">HP 15 vs. HP Stream 13: failed take</a></h3><p>One of the earlier takes. I tried doing a reboot instead of start-up comparison, but the touchpad on the HP stream didn't click. It's a "Synaptics ClickPad" while the one on my own laptop is just a regular Synaptics touchpad. The "clickpad" feels like it has two pressure levels, like the newer "force touch" macbooks which I've tried at a store once, but it doesn't, it's just shitty quality. Both needed some registry editing to get that stupid "reverse scrolling" setting <b>not</b> to be re-enabled. While the clickpad has a built-in button like the MacBook, it's fucking horrible, the touchpad on my own HP is far, far superior (the macbook's is still the best, but my own HP's isn't too bad). In fact this computer is unusable to my brother without an external mouse, so would it to me.<br/>This video and the previous one were filmed with my iPad mini 2, so you can check out its recording quality too.</p></li>
        <li><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/LSuLWjDyjDE" target="_blank">HP Pavilion a6452.it SSD upgrade</a></h3><p>On July 12, 2016 Amazon had a lot of discounts on various things for Amazon Prime users (Prime Day). I'm not one of them, but I signed up for a 30 day free trial because I found a 240GB SanDisk SSD for €51, which was a pretty good deal (the 120GB model of it is €55 without any discounts!). There was also a 750GB Crucial SSD for €150, but unfortunately I didn't have the money for that, plus I wasn't willing to go through the trouble of taking apart my laptop again and transferring everything from my current 500GB SSD to that one. So I bought this 240GB one and put it in my 2008 HP PC. It has SATA 2, so the performance isn't the greatest, but it's still quite an improvement. I'm no Druaga1, I can't afford to put an SSD in EVERYTHING I have, but SSDs are good, especially now that they're getting cheaper. I'd like to put this SanDisk SSD in my 2009 MacBook Pro instead, but I stripped a screw that holds the hard drive in place years ago and I haven't managed to unscrew it yet. Plus it could have troubles with the EFI firmware, and someone on Twitter even told me the kind of controller my MacBook has may not like it. If I ever manage to get that bloody screw off, I'll try it. If I don't, or if it doesn't work as well as it should on my MacBook, I'll keep this SSD in this older HP PC.<br/>This video was recorded with the iPhone 4S I recently fixed.</p></li>
        <li><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-gCfpYBgnM" target="_blank">2009 MacBook Pro SSD upgrade</a></h3><p>After multiple attempts over the course of more than two years (I even got my dad to try it, without success), I finally managed to get that stripped screw that held the hard drive off, using the "rubber band" method. It's not the first time I tried that method. Despite using a pretty thick rubber band, it kept poking a hole through the rubber band without making the screw budge. This time, I folded the rubber band piece in two, so it was even thicker, and pressed a large screw driver as hard as I could while spinning it...and it worked! So I was able to remove the 500GB mechanical hard drive that was in it, and installed my new SanDisk SSD PLUS 240GB. I booted up an installation flash drive of Mac OS X El Capitan, being sure it wouldn't work, but after about 30 long minutes of waiting for it to install...it rebooted and booted right up! So I started setting up some stuff and downloading applications. I left it running all night to see if it would stop working, and it didn't. I enabled TRIM, which is disabled by default, by running the Terminal command "sudo trimforce enable". The first time it still said TRIM was disabled, but rebooting a second time enabled it. The battery even lasts longer too (about 30 minutes), because SSDs use less power! But if this actually keeps on working, I'll have a real Mac that's fully up to date, which is great. Last time I had a fully updated Mac was in 2012, with Mac OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.2, but any newer version wouldn't work with "unsupported" hard drives and the old EFI firmware. Somehow El Capitan boots up on this SSD, even with the old EFI firmware! The speed is limited to 1.5 Gbps, but that's still much faster than the mechanical HDD. If I upgrade the EFI firmware, it will bump up the speed to 3 Gbps, but I'm afraid it will be unbearably slow just like the mechanical HDD if I upgraded the EFI firmware, because this SanDisk SSD is "not supported" by Apple just like the WD Scorpio Blue HDD I had previously. And it turns out this SSD works just fine with the NVIDIA MCP79 chipset. I just need to buy a new battery now, and I'll have a pretty great-working MacBook Pro! I could even try Sierra with that patch tool when the final version comes out, but El Capitan is good enough.</p></li>

No, I don't like One Direction and I never will, but I've heard songs much worse than "Story of My Life".<br/>Also, if it wasn't obvious enough, that's not an actual CD, it's my iPad mini displaying the album artwork I just googled.</p></li>
        <li><h3><a href="https://youtu.be/RUxPfd8AkJo" target="_blank">Windows Embedded POSReady 2009 on an HP Pavilion a6452.it</a></h3><p>Same as above, except it's running natively on my 2008 HP PC this time, no virtual machines. There's more background noise (which I tried to reduce using a feature in iMovie), because for these tests I'm using an old 40GB IDE drive from 2002, which is noisy and on its last legs (it has over 500 bad sectors and crashes with an INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE BSOD most of the time).<br/>Yes, that's a Pringles speaker. I got it for free a couple of years ago, when they had that "buy three cans and get a speaker" offer. It took like two months to arrive, but I can't complain. It runs on three AAA batteries, and even if it's mono, it's a pretty decent and loud speaker.</p></li>

It worked! All I had to do before the upgrade was update the Clover bootloader and a kext file (Voodoo PS/2 Controller). After the upgrade, I re-installed the audio driver (VoodooHDA) which was gone for some reason, and everything worked fine! Also, it's in retina display (hiDPI) resolution, courtesy of a little program called SwitchResX (google it). The best-looking retina display resolution on a display with only 1366*768 pixels is four times 1280*720, which is 2560*1440. Stuff on the screen is only slightly bigger than usual, but the native resolution without high DPI mode looks the best.</p></li>

The pink tint is a defect with the HTC One M7 camera. The video quality sucks, but the audio quality is much better than it would have been if I had filmed with my iPhone.<br/>The volume was all the way up on both computers. On the HP, every sound "enhancement" was turned off. Yes, my HP is running Windows 7, but it's installed on a VHD file which is being booted from natively, my main OS is still Windows 10.</p></li>

Well, Italian isn't one of them, but this gave me an excuse to check this app out on my iPad mini 2. It teaches children the basics of programming in the Swift programming language. I'm used to Java (it's what I learned at university), so I started from the beginning. It makes you use commands to move a weird character in a cartoon world. I'm a bit too old for this app, but it was a bit of a challenge for me too! It's quite a fun app. I noticed that it had a setting to live stream (probably some standard iOS 10 API or something). When I clicked it, it took me to the App Store and only showed two apps: Periscope and something else I forgot the name of. Periscope is Twitter's live streaming service, so I chose that. I began live streaming at this link, where you can see the recorded thing: <a href="https://www.periscope.tv/w/1BdGYPoZBWMKX" target="_blank">https://www.periscope.tv/w/1BdGYPoZBWMKX</a>. Unfortunately, the quality was low and it didn't record any sound. So I gave up, but because I had nothing else to do I decided to record a video of me finishing that level, which I uploaded without any editing. I could do a &quot;let's play&quot; series of this game or something, but I probably won't, especially because ain't nobody got time for that.</p></li>
