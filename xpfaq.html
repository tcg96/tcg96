        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <h2>Frequently asked questions about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7pOjy7--iQ">Windows XP phone activation in 2018 video</a></h2>
        <h6><em>(even though they're not all questions)</em></h6>
        <hr/>
        <div class="text">
<h3>Is it free?</h3>
<p>Yes. You pay for the Windows license (product key), not shown in the video. You enter your product key during the Windows installation. Activation just verifies that your Windows license is genuine. During activation, you only pay for the call (if you don't call a toll-free number) or the Internet connection.<br>Look at it this way: Windows activation&nbsp;=&nbsp;Windows license verification</p>

<h3>What's with the mixture of languages?</h3>
<p>I live in Italy, so I called an Italian number, but I put the title and subtitles in English so more people in the world would understand it. And some viewers <a href="http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?ref=share&v=H7pOjy7--iQ" target="_blank">submitted the title and subtitles in other languages</a>, which I checked with Google Translate and they seem correct enough, so I approved them.<br>But to clarify: I only speak English and Italian.</p>

<h3>You should have told them you don't have an Internet-enabled phone!</h3>
<p>See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss-mteaZQbQ" target="_blank">rogueamp's video</a> for what would happen in that case.</p>

<h3>How the hell did it work? Windows XP's support ended in April 2014!</h3>
<p>That's for tech support and security updates. Activation must carry on working, otherwise every computer running Windows XP would be rendered useless, causing people who can't install a supported operating system to throw out perfectly good equipment and adding more waste to the planet.</p>

<h3>I tried activating Windows XP too and it didn't work for me!</h3>
<p>Either your license was not accepted, or there's some other problem that I don't know about.</p>

<h3>Who cares about activation? Just use it even if it's not activated!</h3>
<p>It's not like Windows 10 that just shows a little notification because Microsoft wants as many people to use it as possible. If you don't activate Windows XP within 30 days, you can't use it at all (unless you're in the very limited Safe Mode). See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcEycj_50hA&t=485" target="_blank">VWestlife's video</a> about it (skip to 8:05).</p>

<h3>How about activating a Windows version older than XP?</h3>
<p>Windows activation was invented with XP, so older versions don't have it. But if you really want to see that, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-VCF-7hchA" target="_blank">I made a video about activating Windows 95</a>.</p>

<h3>How about activating a Windows version newer than XP?</h3>
<p>Just connect to the Internet and it will automatically activate without saying anything. I don't know if or how phone activation works in those versions. Windows XP supports Internet activation too, but I had trouble with it.</p>

<h3>Why not use an illegal crack?</h3>
<p>Because I have a legit license.</p>

<h3>That takes too long! You should have used an illegal crack anyway!</h3>
<p>I don't have an illegal crack. Looking for one takes even longer.</p>

<h3>Why not use a corporate installation of XP with a volume license key? That won't require activation.</h3>
<p>Because I don't have a legit volume license key.</p>

<h3>Ha! I got your product key!</h3>
<p>No, you didn't.</p>

<h3>XP is old!</h3>
<p>But gold!</p>

<h3>What computer is that?</h3>
<p>It's a Lenovo ThinkPad T60, a high-end laptop computer from 2006.</p>

<h3>Where did you get your legit Windows XP license?</h3>
<p>It was included with a sticker at the bottom of this computer, because it came with Windows XP Professional.</p>

<h3>Wow, you still use such an old computer?</h3>
<p>Of course, why wouldn't I? But I have newer computers too.</p>

<h3>XP is out of support! Install a supported operating system!</h3>
<p>I don't have Windows XP on this computer anymore, I have Windows 7. But it doesn't matter because Windows 7 is not supported either and I have a different computer running Windows XP. And one running Windows 10.</p>

<h3>Ma se sei italiano, perch&eacute; non hai fatto tutto il video in italiano?</h3>
<p>Perch&eacute; l'inglese &egrave; una lingua molto pi&ugrave; parlata nel mondo e YouTube &egrave; un sito usato in tutto il mondo.</p>
